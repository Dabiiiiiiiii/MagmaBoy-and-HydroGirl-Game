## Description
Grab a friend, and together play as MagmaBoy and HydroGirl, two friends who are exploring and abandoned temple.
But be careful! MagmaBoy can't touch the water puddles, HydroGirl can't touch the lava pools, and neither of them can touch the green goo pools or the level will end! Use the buttons and the platforms to get to the doors, and into the next room. 

## Installation

When installing MagmaBoy and HydroGirl make sure to have PyGame installed.
  To install pygame in Linux run the following commands:
 ```
  $ apt-get build-dep python-pygame
  $ apt-get install mercurial python-dev python-numpy ffmpeg libsdl-image1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev libsmpeg-dev libsdl1.2-dev libportmidi-dev libswscale-dev libavformat-dev libavcodec-dev
  $ pip install pygame
 ```
 
## Usage

The usage of this game is really simple. Once the Installation procedure has been done, just go to the folder where `main.py` is in your computer and run
```
python main.py
```
in the terminal. Once you have done this, a screen will pop up showing you the menu and directions.

Welcome to MagmaBoy and HydroGirl, a two-player platforming game inspired by Fireboy and Watergirl! Grab a friend and together play as MagmaBoy and HydroGirl, two friends exploring an abandoned temple. But be careful! MagmaBoy can't touch the water puddles, HydroGirl can't touch the lava pools, and neither of them can touch the green goo pools or the level will end! Use the buttons, platforms, and collaboration to get to the final doors and into the next room.

### Goals of our Project

The main goal of our project was to recreate one of our favorite childhood games (Fireboy and Watergirl) in pygame. This meant we had the following subgoals in order to achieve our final product.

- Implement two players

- Implement physics (jumping, collisions, death)

- Use classes and an MCV architecture to organize our code

- Gain experience making sprites and graphics

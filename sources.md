# Our Inspiration and Sources


### Fireboy and Watergirl

Our game was heavily inspired and based on the game Fireboy and Watergirl (which can be played [here](https://fireboyand-watergirl.co/))

### Pygame

We used the [pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/news) and various pygame tutorials to help us with our project
 - [Platformers in pygame](https://coderslegacy.com/python/pygame-platformer-game-development/)
